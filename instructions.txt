Step 1
Set up your HTML with the DOCTYPE, html indicating this document 
is in English, head, and body elements.

Give your head element the appropriate meta elements for the 
charset and viewport, a title element with an appropriate title, 
and a link element for your stylesheet.

Step 2
Within your body element, nest a section element within a main element.

Step 3
Within your section element, add an h1 element with a nested span element.
